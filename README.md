# AustralianElection2022

Welcome to Australian Federal Election 2022 Results Tracker! This gem was created for my Phase 3 Ruby assignment with Academy Xi. It scrapes results data from the Australian Electoral Commission website for the House of Representatives in the 2022 federal election. You can view two-party-preferred and primary vote results for any of the 151 electorates. You may choose an electorate from all 151 electorates or choose a specific state or territory to select an electorate from.

## Installation

Install the gem and add to the application's Gemfile by executing:

    $ bundle add australian_election_2022

If bundler is not being used to manage dependencies, install the gem by executing:

    $ gem install australian_election_2022

## Usage

Run ./bin/australian_election_2022 to start the application.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and the created tag, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
